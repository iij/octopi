[Parameters]

  vni      :=  "all" | number | "any"
	Specifies the virtual network identifier (VNI).
	"all" means all the VNI rules that exist.
	"any" matches all VNIs that are not defined for fallback.

  address  :=  IPv4 Address | IPv6 Address

  target   :=  address/mask | "default" | "default6"
	"default" will match all IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.0/0).
	"default6" matches all IPv6 addresses (::/0).

  relay    :=  addr | "drop" | "broadcast"
	Specifies the address of the octopi daemon to relay to.
	If the destination contains "drop", all destinations are disabled.
	If "broadcast" is included in the destination, broadcast is performed.

  protocol :=  "ipv4" | "ipv6" | "all"
	Specify the protocol. If "all" is specified, both IPv4 and IPv6.

  action   := "allow" | "deny"
	Specify whether to allow or disallow access restrictions.

  utype    := "auto" | "relay" | "member" | "both"
	Specifies the type of address. If omitted or "auto" is specified,
	"relay" will be searched first, and if not found, "member" will
	be searched.

  node     := "all" | "backup" | address
	Specify the address of the synchronous node. Whether the address is
	"relay" or "member" is specified in the prefix.


[Rule command]

  octopi [rule] init [pool_size  [hash_size]]
	Initialize the rule file. the daemon needs to be restarted.

  octopi [rule] list [vni [protocol]]
	Display the rule list in command format.

  octopi [rule] show [vni [protocol]]
	Display the structure of the rule in longest path matching tree format.

  octopi [rule] find vni (address | protocol)
	Search for a rule and output the forwarding destination.
	If protocol name is given, it searches for a broadcast.

  octopi [rule] add vni target relay [relay...]
	Add forwarding information to the rule.

  octopi [rule] delete vni target [relay...]
	Detete forwarding information to the rule.
	Delete all forwarding information if the destination was omitted.

  octopi [rule] move vni target relay [relay...]
	Modify the forwarding information for the rule
	(same as delete before add).

  octopi [rule] flush vni [proto]
	Remove all forwarding information from the rule to the VNI.	

  octopi [rule] save [vni [protocol]]
	Output the rule list in saved format.

	rule vni
	target relay [relay...]
	...
	(commit | abort)

  octopi [rule] update [protocol]
	Load the saved format from the standard input and add it to
	the current rules.

  octopi [rule] restore [protocol]
	Load the save format from the standard input and replace it with
	the current rules.


[Synchronous Access Control Commands]

  octopi acl list [protocol]
	Outputs ACLs for rule synchronization in command format.

  octopi acl add target action
	Add the ACL for rule synchronization.

  octopi acl delete target action
	Remove the ACL for rule synchronization.
		     

[Synchronization node command]

  octopi backup list
	Display the list of backup nodes in command format.

  octopi backup add member [member ...]
	Add members to the backup node list.

  octopi backup delete [member ...]
	Delete members of a backup node list.
	If the members is omitted, all backup node are deleted.

  octopi node list [relay ...]
	Display the list of synchronous nodes in command format.

  octopi node add relay [member ...]
  	Add members to the synchronous node list.
	If the member is omitted, add the same address as the relay address.

  octopi node delete relay [member ...]
	Delete members to the synchronous node list.
	If the members is omitted, all members of that relay address are
	deleted.


[Queue synchronization command]

  octopi queue init [pool_size [hash_size]]
	Initialize the synchronization queue file.

  octopi queue list [relay ...]
	Display the contents of the synchronization queue

  octopi queue show [relay ...]
	Show the structure of synchronous nodes and queues

  octopi queue add [utype] node [vni]
	Manually add a synchronization rule target.

  octopi queue delete [utype] node [vni]
	Manually delete a synchronization rule target.

  octopi queue sync [[utype] node]
	Same as octopi sync. See below.


[Management command]

  octopi [rule] sync
	Write rule data in memory to a file, and
	Perform one-shot rule synchronization now.

  octopi [rule] pause
	Set the Suspend flag for rules and temporarily disable all rules,
	the daemon to non-relay (backup) mode.

  octopi [rule] unpause
	Unset the Suspend flag for rules, the daemon to relay (active) mode.

  octopi [rule] fsck [normal | all]
	Repair corrupt rule files.

  octopi [rule] dump [header | all]
	Dump the contents of the rule file for debugging.

  octopi queue disable
	Set the stop synchronization flag to disable the synchronization
	function.

  octopi queue enable
	Remove the stop synchronization flag and re-enable the
	synchronization function.

  octopi queue dump [header | all]
	Dump the contents of the synchronization queue for debugging.
