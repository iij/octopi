  - Specify the port number that the daemon uses to relay packets.

  timeout		[milli-second]	default: 0 (disabled)
  - Specifies the allowable packet delay in milliseconds.
  - Packets delayed beyond the specified time will be discarded. Time
    synchronization is important.
  - If 0 is specified, timestamp check is not performed.

  caster_ttl		[number]	default: 1
  - TTL to be set for relayed multicast packets.
  - Normally, there is no problem leaving it at 1.

  secret		[string]	default: (disabled)
  - Shared secret for MD5 signing during relay.
  - If omitted, MD5 signing and MD5 checking are not performed.


== Number of Processes

  snipper_procs		[number]	default: 1  range: 0-1
  - Specifies the number of octopi_snipper daemon to read packets.
  - Fixed to 1 if used.

  dispatcher_procs	[number]	default: 8  range: 0-100
  - Specifies the number of octopi_snipper daemon to relay packet.
  - It is recommended to specify the number of CPU cores.

  caster_procs		[numbe]		default: 4  range: 0-100
  - Specifies the number of octopi_caster daemon processes to broadcat.
  - It is recommended to specify about half of the number of CPU cores.

  logger_procs		[number]	default: 1  range: 0-1
  - Specifies the number of processes of the octopi_logger daemon that
    output the statistics log.
  - Specify 0 or 1. 0 means no statistics log is output.

  listner_procs		[number]	default: 0  range: 0-100
  - Specifies the number of octopi_listener daemon to listen for rule
    synchronization.
  - For children of rule synchronization, it is recommended to specify
    about 2.

  kicker_procs		[number]	default: 0  range: 0-1
  - Specifies the number of octopi_kicker daemon processes to
    synchronize rules periodically.
  - If 0 is specified, periodic rule synchronization will not be performed.

  talker_procs		[number]	default: 8  range: 0-100
  - Specifies the maximum number of octopi_talker processes that will
    perform rule synchronization.  
  - This is the limit of the number of parallelism when synchronizing
    rules to multiple destinations at the same time.
  - If you have a large number of rule synchronization destinations, you
    can use a large value. (As long as you have enough memory).


== Rule Database Settings

  rule_file		[path]		default: /var/octopi/octopidb
  - Specify the location of the rules database.

  pool_size		[number]	default: 1000000  range: 1000-16777216
  - Specify the size of the rule pool.
  - This value is used when the pool size is omitted when creating.
  - It is recommended to specify at least 10 times the number of rules
    that are expected to be used.

  hash_size		[number]	default: 231313   range: 1000-16777216
  - Specifies the size of the VNI hash in the rule file.
  - This value is used when the hash size is omitted when creating.
  - It is recommended to specify a prime number that is at least twice
    the number of networks expected to be used.


== Synchronization Queue Settings

  queue_file		[path]		default: /var/octopi/octopiqueue
  - Specifies the location of the synchronization queue.

  queue_pool_size	[number]	default: 100000  range: 1000-16777216
  - Specifies the size of the synchronization queue.
  - This value is used when the size s omitted at when creating.
  - The recommended value is about the number of networks to be used.

  hash_size		[number]	default: 23131   range: 1000-16777216
  - Specifies the size of the destination address hash of the
    synchronization queue.
  - This value is used when the hash size is omitted when creating.
  - It is recommended to specify a prime number that is at least five
    times larger than the synchronization destination.


== Synchronization Settings

  sync_address		[address]	default: ::
  - Specify the listening address for rule synchronization.
  - If 0.0.0.0 is specified, it will be all IPv4 attached to the server.
  - If :: is specified, all IPv6 attached to the server will be used.
    IPv6 mapped IPv4 allows you to connect to IPv4 as well.

  sync_port		[number]	default: 24789
  - Specify the port number to use for rule synchronization.

  sync_timeout		[milli-second]	default: 60000
  - Specifies the maximum allowable delay time when synchronizing rules.
  - If this time is exceeded, the synchronization is aborted, returned
    to the queue, and resent later.

  sync_interval		[milli-second]	default: 60000
  - Specifies the interval at which rule synchronization is kicked
    periodically.
  - If 0 is specified, automatic rule synchronization will not be
    started automatically  

  sync_buffer		[bytes]		default: 65536
  - Specify the initial size of the buffer for rule synchronization.
  - No need to change it in general, because it will be expanded as needed.
