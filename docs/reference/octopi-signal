== Reload signal

  - There is no reload signal, so you need to stop/start when you
    rewrite octopi.conf

== Terminate signal

  - If you just want to stop it for now, "pkill octopid".

		parent (launcher)	child (snipper, dispatcher, ...)
    SIGINT	terminate all	-->	terminate all
    SIGTERM	terminate all	-->	terminate all


== Debug signal

  - The following three are for debugging and do not need to be used normally
  
		parent (launcher)	child (snipper, dispatcher, ...)
    SIGHUP	restart child	-->	terminate
    SIGUSR1	Start debug logging	Start debug logging
    SIGUSR2	Stop debug logging	Stop debug logging
